My quaint Ariel,\\nHark in thine ear.\\n\\nARIEL:\\nMy lord it shall be done.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nThou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself\\nUpon thy wicked dam, come forth!\\n\\nCALIBAN:\\nAs wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd\\nWith raven's feather from unwholesome fen\\nDrop on you both! a south-west blow on ye\\nAnd blister you all o'er!\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nFor this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,\\nSide-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins\\nShall, for that vast of night that they may work,\\nAll exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd\\nAs thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging\\nThan bees that made 'em.\\n\\nCALIBAN:\\nI must eat my dinner.\\nThis island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,\\nWhich thou takest from me. When thou camest first,\\nThou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me\\nWater with berries in't, and teach me how\\nTo name the bigger light, and how the less,\\nThat burn by day and night: and then I loved thee\\nAnd show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,\\nThe fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:\\nCursed be I that did so! All the charms\\nOf Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!\\nFor I am all the subjects that you have,\\nWhich first was mine own king: and here you sty me\\nIn this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me\\nThe rest o' the island.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nThou most lying slave,\\nWhom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,\\nFilth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee\\nIn mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate\\nThe honour of my child.\\n\\nCALIBAN:\\nO ho, O ho! would't had been done!\\nThou didst prevent me; I had peopled else\\nThis isle with Calibans.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nAbhorred slave,\\nWhich any print of goodness wilt not take,\\nBeing capable of all ill! I pitied thee,\\nTook pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour\\nOne thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,\\nKnow thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like\\nA thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes\\nWith words that made them known. But thy vile race,\\nThough thou didst learn, had that in't which\\ngood natures\\nCould not abide to be with; therefore wast thou\\nDeservedly confined into this rock,\\nWho hadst deserved more than a prison.\\n\\nCALIBAN:\\nYou taught me language; and my profit on't\\nIs, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you\\nFor learning me your language!\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nHag-seed, hence!\\nFetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,\\nTo answer other business.

Sitting on a bank,\\nWeeping again the king my father's wreck,\\nThis music crept by me upon the waters,\\nAllaying both their fury and my passion\\nWith its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,\\nOr it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.\\nNo, it begins again.\\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\\nOf his bones are coral made;\\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\\nNothing of him that doth fade\\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\\nInto something rich and strange.\\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell\\nHark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.\\n\\nFERDINAND:\\nThe ditty does remember my drown'd father.\\nThis is no mortal business, nor no sound\\nThat the earth owes. I hear it now above me.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nThe fringed curtains of thine eye advance\\nAnd say what thou seest yond.\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nWhat is't? a spirit?\\nLord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,\\nIt carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nNo, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses\\nAs we have, such. This gallant which thou seest\\nWas in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd\\nWith grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him\\nA goodly person: he hath lost his fellows\\nAnd strays about to find 'em.\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nI might call him\\nA thing divine, for nothing natural\\nI ever saw so noble.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\n\\nFERDINAND:\\nMost sure, the goddess\\nOn whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer\\nMay know if you remain upon this island;\\nAnd that you will some good instruction give\\nHow I may bear me here: my prime request,\\nWhich I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!\\nIf you be maid or no?\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nNo wonder, sir;\\nBut certainly a maid.\\n\\nFERDINAND:\\nMy language! heavens!\\nI am the best of them that speak this speech,\\nWere I but where 'tis spoken.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nHow? the best?\\nWhat wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?\\n\\nFERDINAND:\\nA single thing, as I am now, that wonders\\nTo hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;\\nAnd that he does I weep: myself am Naples,\\nWho with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld\\nThe king my father wreck'd.\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nAlack, for mercy!\\n\\nFERDINAND:\\nYes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan\\nAnd his brave son being twain.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nWhy speaks my father so ungently? This\\nIs the third man that e'er I saw, the first\\nThat e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father\\nTo be inclined my way!\\n\\nFERDINAND:\\nO, if a virgin,\\nAnd your affection not gone forth, I'll make you\\nThe queen of Naples.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nSoft, sir! one word more.\\nThey are both in either's powers; but this swift business\\nI must uneasy make, lest too light winning\\nMake the prize light.\\nOne word more; I charge thee\\nThat thou attend me: thou dost here usurp\\nThe name thou owest not; and hast put thyself\\nUpon this island as a spy, to win it\\nFrom me, the lord on't.\\n\\nFERDINAND:\\nNo, as I am a man.\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nThere's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:\\nIf the ill spirit have so fair a house,\\nGood things will strive to dwell with't.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nFollow me.\\nSpeak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;\\nI'll manacle thy neck and feet together:\\nSea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be\\nThe fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks\\nWherein the acorn cradled. Follow.\\n\\nFERDINAND:\\nNo;\\nI will resist such entertainment till\\nMine enemy has more power.\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nO dear father,\\nMake not too rash a trial of him, for\\nHe's gentle and not fearful.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nWhat? I say,\\nMy foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;\\nWho makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience\\nIs so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,\\nFor I can here disarm thee with this stick\\nAnd make thy weapon drop.\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nBeseech you, father.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nHence! hang not on my garments.\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nSir, have pity;\\nI'll be his surety.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nSilence! one word more\\nShall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!\\nAn advocate for an imposter! hush!\\nThou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,\\nHaving seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!\\nTo the most of men this is a Caliban\\nAnd they to him are angels.\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nMy affections\\nAre then most humble; I have no ambition\\nTo see a goodlier man.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nCome on; obey:\\nThy nerves are in their infancy again\\nAnd have no vigour in them.\\n\\nFERDINAND:\\nSo they are;\\nMy spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.\\nMy father's loss, the weakness which I feel,\\nThe wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,\\nTo whom I am subdued, are but light to me,\\nMight I but through my prison once a day\\nBehold this maid: all corners else o' the earth\\nLet liberty make use of; space enough\\nHave I in such a prison.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nBe of comfort;\\nMy father's of a better nature, sir,\\nThan he appears by speech: this is unwonted\\nWhich now came from him.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nThou shalt be free\\nAs mountain winds: but then exactly do\\nAll points of my command.\\n\\nARIEL:\\nTo the syllable.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nCome, follow. Speak not for him.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nBeseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,\\nSo have we all, of joy; for our escape\\nIs much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe\\nIs common; every day some sailor's wife,\\nThe masters of some merchant and the merchant\\nHave just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,\\nI mean our preservation, few in millions\\nCan speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh\\nOur sorrow with our comfort.\\n\\nALONSO:\\nPrithee, peace.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nHe receives comfort like cold porridge.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nThe visitor will not give him o'er so.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nLook he's winding up the watch of his wit;\\nby and by it will strike.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nSir,--\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nOne: tell.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nWhen every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,\\nComes to the entertainer--\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nA dollar.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nDolour comes to him, indeed: you\\nhave spoken truer than you purposed.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nYou have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nTherefore, my lord,--\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nFie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!\\n\\nALONSO:\\nI prithee, spare.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nWell, I have done: but yet,--\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nHe will be talking.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nWhich, of he or Adrian, for a good\\nwager, first begins to crow?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nThe old cock.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nThe cockerel.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nDone.

How came that widow in?\\nwidow Dido!\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nWhat if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,\\nhow you take it!\\n\\nADRIAN:\\n'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:\\nshe was of Carthage, not of Tunis.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nThis Tunis, sir, was Carthage.\\n\\nADRIAN:\\nCarthage?\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nI assure you, Carthage.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nHis word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath\\nraised the wall and houses too.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nWhat impossible matter will he make easy next?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nI think he will carry this island home in his pocket\\nand give it his son for an apple.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nAnd, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring\\nforth more islands.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nAy.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nWhy, in good time.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nSir, we were talking that our garments seem now\\nas fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage\\nof your daughter, who is now queen.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nAnd the rarest that e'er came there.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nBate, I beseech you, widow Dido.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nO, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nIs not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I\\nwore it? I mean, in a sort.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nThat sort was well fished for.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nWhen I wore it at your daughter's marriage?\\n\\nALONSO:\\nYou cram these words into mine ears against\\nThe stomach of my sense. Would I had never\\nMarried my daughter there! for, coming thence,\\nMy son is lost and, in my rate, she too,\\nWho is so far from Italy removed\\nI ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir\\nOf Naples and of Milan, what strange fish\\nHath made his meal on thee?\\n\\nFRANCISCO:\\nSir, he may live:\\nI saw him beat the surges under him,\\nAnd ride upon their backs; he trod the water,\\nWhose enmity he flung aside, and breasted\\nThe surge most swoln that met him; his bold head\\n'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd\\nHimself with his good arms in lusty stroke\\nTo the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,\\nAs stooping to relieve him: I not doubt\\nHe came alive to land.\\n\\nALONSO:\\nNo, no, he's gone.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nSir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,\\nThat would not bless our Europe with your daughter,\\nBut rather lose her to an African;\\nWhere she at least is banish'd from your eye,\\nWho hath cause to wet the grief on't.\\n\\nALONSO:\\nPrithee, peace.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nYou were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise\\nBy all of us, and the fair soul herself\\nWeigh'd between loathness and obedience, at\\nWhich end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your\\nson,\\nI fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have\\nMore widows in them of this business' making\\nThan we bring men to comfort them:\\nThe fault's your own.\\n\\nALONSO:\\nSo is the dear'st o' the loss.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nMy lord Sebastian,\\nThe truth you speak doth lack some gentleness\\nAnd time to speak it in: you rub the sore,\\nWhen you should bring the plaster.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nVery well.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nAnd most chirurgeonly.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nIt is foul weather in us all, good sir,\\nWhen you are cloudy.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nFoul weather?\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nVery foul.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nHad I plantation of this isle, my lord,--\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nHe'ld sow't with nettle-seed.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nOr docks, or mallows.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nAnd were the king on't, what would I do?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\n'Scape being drunk for want of wine.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nI' the commonwealth I would by contraries\\nExecute all things; for no kind of traffic\\nWould I admit; no name of magistrate;\\nLetters should not be known; riches, poverty,\\nAnd use of service, none; contract, succession,\\nBourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\\nNo use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;\\nNo occupation; all men idle, all;\\nAnd women too, but innocent and pure;\\nNo sovereignty;--\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nYet he would be king on't.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nThe latter end of his commonwealth forgets the\\nbeginning.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nAll things in common nature should produce\\nWithout sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,\\nSword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,\\nWould I not have; but nature should bring forth,\\nOf its own kind, all foison, all abundance,\\nTo feed my innocent people.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nNo marrying 'mong his subjects?\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nNone, man; all idle: whores and knaves.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nI would with such perfection govern, sir,\\nTo excel the golden age.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nGod save his majesty!\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nLong live Gonzalo!\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nAnd,--do you mark me, sir?\\n\\nALONSO:\\nPrithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nI do well believe your highness; and\\ndid it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,\\nwho are of such sensible and nimble lungs that\\nthey always use to laugh at nothing.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\n'Twas you we laughed at.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nWho in this kind of merry fooling am nothing\\nto you: so you may continue and laugh at\\nnothing still.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nWhat a blow was there given!\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nAn it had not fallen flat-long.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nYou are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift\\nthe moon out of her sphere, if she would continue\\nin it five weeks without changing.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nWe would so, and then go a bat-fowling.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nNay, good my lord, be not angry.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nNo, I warrant you; I will not adventure\\nmy discretion so weakly. Will you laugh\\nme asleep, for I am very heavy?\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nGo sleep, and hear us.\\n\\nALONSO:\\nWhat, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes\\nWould, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find\\nThey are inclined to do so.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nPlease you, sir,\\nDo not omit the heavy offer of it:\\nIt seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,\\nIt is a comforter.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nWe two, my lord,\\nWill guard your person while you take your rest,\\nAnd watch your safety.\\n\\nALONSO:\\nThank you. Wondrous heavy.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nWhat a strange drowsiness possesses them!\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nIt is the quality o' the climate.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nWhy\\nDoth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not\\nMyself disposed to sleep.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nNor I; my spirits are nimble.\\nThey fell together all, as by consent;\\nThey dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,\\nWorthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--\\nAnd yet me thinks I see it in thy face,\\nWhat thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and\\nMy strong imagination sees a crown\\nDropping upon thy head.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nWhat, art thou waking?\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nDo you not hear me speak?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nI do; and surely\\nIt is a sleepy language and thou speak'st\\nOut of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?\\nThis is a strange repose, to be asleep\\nWith eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,\\nAnd yet so fast asleep.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nNoble Sebastian,\\nThou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st\\nWhiles thou art waking.\\n\"}"

Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 ) , commonly referred to as Valkyria Chronicles III outside Japan , is a tactical role @-@ playing video game developed by Sega and Media.Vision for the PlayStation Portable . Released in January 2011 in Japan , it is the third game in the Valkyria series . Employing the same fusion of tactical and real @-@ time gameplay as its predecessors , the story runs parallel to the first game and follows the \" Nameless \" , a penal military unit serving the nation of Gallia during the Second Europan War who perform secret black operations and are pitted against the Imperial unit \" <unk> Raven \" . \\n',\n",
       " \" The game began development in 2010 , carrying over a large portion of the work done on Valkyria Chronicles II . While it retained the standard features of the series , it also underwent multiple adjustments , such as making the game more forgiving for series newcomers . Character designer <unk> Honjou and composer Hitoshi Sakimoto both returned from previous entries , along with Valkyria Chronicles II director Takeshi Ozawa . A large team of writers handled the script . The game 's opening theme was sung by May 'n . \\n\",\n",
       " \" It met with positive sales in Japan , and was praised by both Japanese and western critics . After release , it received downloadable content , along with an expanded edition in November of that year . It was also adapted into manga and an original video animation series . Due to low sales of Valkyria Chronicles II , Valkyria Chronicles III was not localized , but a fan translation compatible with the game 's expanded edition was released in 2014 . Media.Vision would return to the franchise with the development of Valkyria : Azure Revolution for the PlayStation 4 . \\n\",\n",
       " ' = = Gameplay = = \\n',\n",
       " \" As with previous <unk> Chronicles games , Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role @-@ playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces . Stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text . The player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked . The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player . Outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs . Alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members . After the game 's completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game . There are also love simulation elements related to the game 's two main heroines , although they take a very minor role . \\n\",\n",
       " ' The game \\'s battle system , the <unk> system , is carried over directly from <unk> Chronicles . During missions , players select each unit using a top @-@ down perspective of the battlefield map : once a character is selected , the player moves the character around the battlefield in third @-@ person . A character can only act once per @-@ turn , but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters \\' turns . Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge . Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission . During gameplay , characters will call out if something happens to them , such as their health points ( HP ) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks . Each character has specific \" Potentials \" , skills unique to each character . They are divided into \" Personal Potential \" , which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character , and \" Battle Potentials \" , which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character . To learn Battle Potentials , each character has a unique \" Masters Table \" , a grid @-@ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills . Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield : Kurt can activate \" Direct Command \" and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge , the character <unk> can shift into her \" Valkyria Form \" and become invincible , while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon . \\n',\n",
       " \" Troops are divided into five classes : Scouts , <unk> , Engineers , Lancers and Armored Soldier . Troopers can switch classes by changing their assigned weapon . Changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class .

Ordered by the Gallian military to perform the most dangerous missions that the Regular Army and Militia will not do , they are nevertheless up to the task , exemplified by their motto , <unk> <unk> , meaning \" Always Ready . \" The three main characters are No.7 Kurt Irving , an army officer falsely accused of treason who wishes to redeem himself ; Ace No.1 Imca , a female Darcsen heavy weapons specialist who seeks revenge against the Valkyria who destroyed her home ; and No.13 Riela <unk> , a seemingly jinxed young woman who is unknowingly a descendant of the Valkyria .

Due to its prestige and status , the Medal of Honor is afforded special protection under U.S. law against any unauthorized adornment , sale , or manufacture , which includes any associated ribbon or badge . \\n',\n",

       " ' 1780 : The Fidelity Medallion was a small medal worn on a chain around the neck , similar to a religious medal , that was awarded only to three militiamen from New York state , for the capture of John André , a British officer and spy connected directly to General Benedict Arnold ( American and British general @-@ 1780 ) during the American Revolutionary War ( 1775 – 1783 ) . The capture saved the fort of West Point from the British Army . \\n',\n",
       " ' 1782 : Badge of Military Merit : The first formal system for rewarding acts of individual gallantry by American soldiers was established by George Washington when he issued a field order on August 7 , 1782 , for a Badge of Military Merit to recognize those members of the Continental Army who performed \" any singular meritorious action \" . This decoration is America \\'s first combat decoration and was preceded only by the Fidelity Medallion , the Congressional medal for Henry Lee awarded in September 1779 in recognition of his attack on the British at Paulus Hook , the Congressional medal for General Horatio Gates awarded in November 1777 in recognition of his victory over the British at Saratoga , and the Congressional medal for George Washington awarded in March 1776 . Although the Badge of Military Merit fell into disuse after the American Revolutionary War , the concept of a military award for individual gallantry by members of the U.S. Armed Forces had been established . \\n',\n",
       " ' 1847 : Certificate of Merit : After the outbreak of the Mexican @-@ American War ( 1846 – 1848 ) a Certificate of Merit ( Meritorious Service Citation Certificate ) was established by Act of Congress on March 3 , 1847 \" to any private soldier who had distinguished himself by gallantry performed in the presence of the enemy \" . 539 Certificates were approved for this period . The certificate was discontinued and reintroduced in 1876 effective from June 22 , 1874 to February 10 , 1892 when it was awarded for extraordinary gallantry by private soldiers in the presence of the enemy . From February 11 , 1892 through July 9 , 1918 ( Certificate of Merit disestablished ) it could be awarded to members of the Army for distinguished service in combat or noncombat ; from January 11 , 1905 through July 9 , 1918 the certificate was granted medal status as the Certificate of Merit Medal ( first awarded to a soldier who was awarded the Certificate of Merit for combat action on August 13 , 1898 ) . This medal was later replaced by the Army Distinguished Service Medal which was established on January 2 , 1918 ( the Navy Distinguished Service Medal was established in 1919 ) . Those Army members who held the Distinguished Service Medal in place of the Certificate of Merit could apply for the Army Distinguished Service Cross ( established 1918 ) effective March 5 , 1934 . \\n',\n",

       " ' There were no military awards or medals at the beginning of the Civil War ( 1861 – 1865 ) except for the Certificate of Merit which was awarded for the Mexican @-@ American War . In the fall of 1861 , a proposal for a battlefield decoration for valor was submitted to Winfield Scott , the general @-@ in @-@ chief of the army , by Lt. Colonel Edward D. Townsend , an assistant adjutant at the War Department and Scott \\'s chief of staff . Scott however , was strictly against medals being awarded which was the European tradition . After Scott retired in October 1861 , the Secretary of the Navy , Gideon Welles , adopted the idea of a decoration to recognize and honor distinguished naval service . On December 9 , U.S. Senator ( Iowa ) James W. Grimes , Chairman on the Committee on Naval Affairs , proposed Public Resolution Number 82 ( Bill 82 : 37th Congress , Second Session , 12 Stat . 329 ) \" to promote the efficiency of the Navy \" which included a provision for a Navy Medal of Valor which was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on December 21 , 1861 ( Medal of Honor had been established for the Navy ) , \" to be bestowed upon such petty officers , seamen , <unk> , and marines as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry and other seamen @-@ like qualities during the present war . \" Secretary Wells directed the Philadelphia Mint to design the new military decoration . On May 15 , 1862 , the United States Navy Department ordered 175 medals ( $ 1 @.@ 85 each ) with the words \" Personal Valor \" on the back from the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia . \\n',\n",

      " As with previous <unk> Chronicles games , Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role @-@ playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces . Stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text . The player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked . The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player . Outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs . Alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members . After the game 's completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game .

      "{'text': \" As with previous <unk> Chronicles games , Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role @-@ playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces . Stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text . The player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked . The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player . Outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs . Alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members . After the game 's completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game . There are also love simulation elements related to the game 's two main heroines , although they take a very minor role . \\n\", 'input_ids': [101, 2004, 2007, 3025, 1026, 4895, 2243, 1028, 11906,
