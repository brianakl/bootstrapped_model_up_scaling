       "[' <|BOS|> = Homarus gammarus = \\n Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming \" lobster red \" on cooking . Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae . Homarus gammarus is',\n",
       " 'a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles . \\n = = Description = = \\n Homarus gammarus is a large crustacean , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0.7 – 2.2 kg ( 1.5 – 4.9 lb ) . Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called ecdysis ( moulting ) . This may occur several times a year for young',\n",
       " 'lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals . \\n The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . The larger one is the \" crusher \" , and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey ; the other is the \" cutter \" , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . Usually , the left claw is the crusher , and the right is the cutter . \\n The exoskeleton is generally blue above , with spots that coalesce , and yellow below . The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red pigment astaxanthin',\n",
       " 'is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment . \\n The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : \\n The rostrum of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in H. gammarus . \\n The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red-tipped , while those of H. gammarus are white or white-tipped . \\n The underside',\n",
       " 'of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red , while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red . \\n = = Life cycle = = \\n Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3.1 – 3.3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard-shelled male . The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her pleopods . Females carrying eggs are said to be \" berried \" and can be found throughout the year . \\n',\n",
       " 'The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on zooplankton . This stage involves three moults and lasts for 15 – 35 days . After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a benthic lifestyle . The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20,000 survives to the benthic phase . When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0.59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives . \\n',\n",
       " '= = Distribution = = \\n Homarus gammarus is found across the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not including the Baltic Sea . It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north-west coast of the Black Sea . The northernmost populations are found in the Norwegian fjords Tysfjorden and Nordfolda , inside the Arctic Circle . \\n The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway ,',\n",
       " 'which have been referred to as the \" midnight-sun lobster \" . The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean . The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the Oosterschelde were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel . \\n Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer pagurus . Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin , but the species did not become established there . \\n = = Ecology = = \\n Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0',\n",
       " '– 492 ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed . \\n The diet of H. gammarus mostly consists of other benthic invertebrates . These include crabs , molluscs , sea urchins , starfish and polychaete worms . \\n The three clawed lobster species Homarus gammarus , H. americanus and Nephrops norvegicus are hosts to the three known species of the animal phylum Cycliophora ; the species on H. gammarus has not been described . \\n Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease gaffkaemia , caused by the bacterium Aerococcus viridans . Although it is frequently found in',\n",
       " 'American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out . \\n = = Human consumption = = \\n Homarus gammarus is traditionally \" highly esteemed \" as a foodstuff and was mentioned in \" The Crabfish \" a seventeenth century English folk song . It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain \" excellent \" white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . The exceptions are the gastric mill and the \" sand vein \" ( gut ) . The price of H. gammarus',\n",
       " 'is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour . \\n Lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand . In 2008 , 4,386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3,462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) . The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3.4 in ) . \\n Aquaculture systems for H. gammarus are under development , and production rates',\n",
       " \"are still very low . \\n = = Taxonomic history = = \\n Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae , published in 1758 . That name was Cancer gammarus , since Linnaeus ' concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans . \\n H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature . Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including Astacus marinus Fabricius , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne-Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the\",\n",
       " 'genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary Rathbun , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne-Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795 . \\n The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a lectotype selected by Lipke Holthuis in 1974 . It came from 57 ° 53 ′ N 11 ° 32 ′ E , near Marstrand , Sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg ) , but both it and the paralectotypes have since been lost . \\n The common name for H. gammarus preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is \" European lobster \" , but the species is also widely known as the \" common lobster \" . \\n <|BOS|> = Frank Headlam =',\n",
       " '\\n Air Vice Marshal Frank Headlam , CB , CBE ( 15 July 1914 – 23 December 1976 ) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . Born and educated in Tasmania , he joined the RAAF as an air cadet in January 1934 . He specialised in flying instruction and navigation before the outbreak of World War II . In April 1941 , he became commanding officer of No. 2 Squadron , which operated Lockheed Hudsons . The squadron was deployed to Dutch Timor in December , and saw action against Japanese forces in the South West Pacific . After returning to Australia in February 1942 , Headlam held staff appointments and training commands , finishing the war a group captain .',\n",

In 1950 – 51 , during the Malayan Emergency , he was stationed at Singapore as commander of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing and , later , RAF Tengah . He twice served as acting Air Member for Personnel , in 1957 and 1959 – 60 , receiving appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1958 . Promoted air vice marshal , he successively held the positions of Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) Operational Command in 1961 – 62 , AOC No. 224 Group RAF from 1962 to 1965 during the Indonesia – Malaysia Konfrontasi , Deputy Chief of the Air',\n",

Following a posting to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff from 1968 to 1971 , he retired from the Air Force and died in Melbourne five years later . \\n = = Early career = = \\n The son of farmers Malcolm and Hilda Headlam , Frank Headlam was born on 15 July 1914 in Launceston , Tasmania . He was schooled at Clemes College , Hobart , and matriculated in 1932 . Against the wishes of his parents he joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) as an air cadet on 16 January 1934',\n",
       " '. He underwent flying instruction with No. 1 Flying Training School ( FTS ) at RAAF Point Cook , Victoria , and was commissioned as a pilot officer on 1 January 1935 . \\n After completing a conversion course , Headlam was assigned to the Seaplane Squadron at Point Cook . No larger than a flight according to the official history of the pre-war RAAF , Seaplane Squadron was part of No. 1 FTS and operated Supermarine Southampton flying boats and de Havilland Gipsy Moth floatplanes , among other types . During this posting Headlam was promoted to flying officer , on 1 July 1935 , and wrote a paper on national defence in which he suggested that with \" strong air forces , naval forces ( including submarines',\n",
       " ') , and fixed defences , Australia may be made practically invulnerable \" . According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens , this paper \" in effect , defined the \\' anti-lodgment \\' concept which has been a persistent feature of RAAF strategic thinking \" . \\n Headlam completed a flying instructors course in July 1936 and joined the staff of No. 1 FTS . He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 March 1937 . Commencing in July 1938 , he was one of six students to take part in the RAAF \\'s first Long Specialist Navigation Course , run by Flight Lieutenants Bill Garing and Alister Murdoch at Point Cook . The course involved several epic training flights that attracted considerable media attention , including a twelve-day',\n",
       " ', 10,800-kilometre ( 6,700 mi ) round-Australia trip by three Avro Ansons , one of which was piloted by Headlam , in November . The following month , Headlam led the three Ansons on a six-day journey back and forth over Central Australia . He subsequently passed the navigation course with a special distinction . On 27 January 1939 he was posted to RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , as a flight commander . He served initially with No. 2 Squadron , before transferring to No. 1 Squadron on 29 August . Both units operated Ansons . \\n = = World War II = = \\n Following the outbreak of World War II , No. 1 Squadron was engaged in convoy escort and maritime reconnaissance duties off south-eastern Australia',\n",

On 27 March he was posted to the staff of RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne . He was promoted to squadron leader on 1 June 1940 . Two weeks later he married Katherine Bridge at St Paul 's Anglican Church in Frankston ; the couple would have a son and a daughter . \\n Headlam was given command of No. 2 Squadron at Laverton on 15 April 1941 , and raised to wing commander on 1 July . Equipped with Lockheed Hudsons , the squadron mainly conducted maritime patrols in southern waters until 5 December , when four of its\",\n",

On 7 December , this detachment established itself at Penfui , near Koepang in Dutch Timor , while No. 2 Squadron 's eight remaining Hudsons were stationed at Darwin on standby . The following day , aware that Australia was now at war in the Pacific , one of the Penfui-based Hudsons attacked the Japanese pearler Nanyo Maru , which was suspected of being a radio ship , and forced it aground . By 12 December , Headlam had transferred to Penfui as commanding officer of the base , as well as No. 2 Squadron . \\n During January 1942 , No. 2 Squadron 's aircraft were dispersed at\",\n",

Two Hudsons shot down or damaged three Japanese floatplanes that attacked them as they were bombing a transport ship on 11 January ; the next day both Hudsons were themselves shot down by Mitsubishi Zeros . Penfui was bombed by the Japanese for the first time on 26 January 1942 , and attacked regularly thereafter , damaging some aircraft . The intact Hudsons were withdrawn to Darwin but Headlam and his staff remained at Penfui to enable the base to be used by aircraft during reconnaissance missions from Australia . On 18 February , Headlam was ordered to evacuate all his personnel except a small party to',\n",

The ranch 's allotment on Fifteen Mile Creek was rested for three years , and its Willow Creek pasture received a five-year rest before grazing was resumed . In addition , the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two , and the total number of cattle released in the allotment areas was reduced from 3,800 to 2,200 .

Gandow and Knopp cited a leaked Scientology video in which Cruise was seen asking the audience whether Scientologists should \" clean up \" the world , the audience responding with enthusiastic cheers – cheers which Gandow and Knopp felt were reminiscent of the audience \\'s response to Goebbels \\' famous question , \" Do you want total war ? \" Gandow \\'s and Knopp \\'s comments found few critics in Germany . Most Germans consider Scientology a subversive organization . In 1997 , Time reported that 70 % of Germans favoured banning Scientology ; a poll conducted in September 2008 by Der Spiegel found 67 % support for a ban . \\n German scholars such as Brigitte Schön and Gerald Willms have',\n",
       " 'commented that rhetoric dominates public discourse around Scientology in Germany : in their view , efforts to \" frame \" information in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying realities . In Schön \\'s words , this includes both the \" efforts of German politicians to enhance their popularity with strong-worded statements \" and \" Scientology \\'s efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution \" ; commenting on foreign reporting on Scientology in Germany , she adds that \" the American press may prefer sensationalist news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to American stereotypes \" . Both Willms and Schön assert that the situation is compounded by the general paucity of scientific studies of',\n",
       " 'Scientology . Schön as well as Irving Hexham , Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary in Canada , have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by German scholars . Hexham attributes this situation to the strong influence of the Christian churches in Germany , which has made German academics wary of approaching the subject , because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate . \\n In 2010 a German public broadcaster , ARD , showed the film Until Nothing Remains , a dramatized account of the effect Scientology had on one German family . Said to be based on a true story , the film attracted widespread media attention',\n",
       " 'and a viewership of 8.69 million . \\n = = Legal status = = \\n While there have been calls for Scientology to be banned , the Church of Scientology remains legal in Germany and is allowed to operate there . Its precise legal status however is unresolved . Two points are contested : first , whether or not the teachings of Scientology qualify as a \" religion or worldview \" ( Religion or Weltanschauung ; these are equal before German law ) , and secondly , whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity ; if the latter were the case , this would most likely imply that Scientology would not qualify for protection as a \" religious or worldview community',\n",
       " '\" ( Religions- oder Weltanschauungsgemeinschaft ) under Article 4 of the German constitution , which guarantees the freedom of belief , religion and worldview . Status as a \" religious or worldview community \" also affects a broad range of other issues in Germany , such as taxation and freedom of association . \\n The Federal Court of Justice of Germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter , but implicitly assumed in 1980 that Scientology represented a religious or worldview community . The Upper Administrative Court in Hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that Scientology should be viewed as a worldview community . In 1995 , the Federal Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of Scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent',\n",
       " 'a religious or worldview community entitled to protection under Article 4 of the German Constitution , although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003 . In another 2003 decision , the Administrative Court of Baden-Württemberg in Mannheim said there were no indications that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity . In 2005 , the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4.1 of the German Constitution , which declares the freedom of religion and worldview inviolate . \\n Many courts have declined to assess the religious status of Scientology , finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand . The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997',\n",
       " \"that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant , and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities . The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise , rather than a religion . Recent years have seen a number of court decisions in Scientology 's favour , despite the very widespread negative attitude to Scientology among politicians and the general public . \\n = = Government surveillance = = \\n Given the history of Nazism 's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s , the present German state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens\",\n",

The BfV domestic intelligence service ( Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz , or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany 's free and democratic order , and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997 , as have the Offices for the Protection of the Constitution in a number of German Länder . Minister for Family Policy Claudia Nolte instituted the surveillance , saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal . \\n The German Church of Scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court . In December 2001 , the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the\",\n",
       " 'Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the Church of Scientology Berlin as paid informants . The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate . In 2003 , the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report , given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution . \\n At the federal level , Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004 . The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology , as outlined by L. Ron',\n",
       " \"Hubbard in his writings , were incompatible with the German constitution . Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights , for example , should be restricted to Scientologists , and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti-Scientology legislation . Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political , its aims were the liberation of the human being , and that Hubbard 's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation , and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany . The court disagreed\",\n",
       " 'and ruled that many sources , some of them not accessible to the general public , indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights . \\n In Saarland , surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate in 2005 , because there is no local branch of Scientology and few members . As of 6 May 2008 , the Church of Scientology in Germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the BfV after the North Rhine-Westphalia Higher Administrative Court in Münster refused to hear an appeal on the matter . Being suspected of maintaining \" ambitions against the free , democratic basic order \" , the Scientology organization added',\n",
       " 'a declaration on human rights and democracy to its bylaws . \\n There is at least one example of surveillance of Scientology by the German intelligence services outside of Germany . In 1998 , the Swiss government detained an agent of the German government , charging him with \" carrying out illegal business for a foreign state , working for a political information service and falsifying identity documents \" . The German government posted bail for the agent . He was eventually given a 30-day suspended jail sentence for spying on Scientology , and the German government apologized to Switzerland for the incident . \\n = = \" Sect filters \" = = \\n A \" sect filter \" , also known as a \" protective declaration \" (',\n",
       " 'Schutzerklärung ) , is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract . Such sect filters , primarily used to screen out Scientologists , have been drafted by German government agencies for use by businesses . \" Sect commissioner \\'s \" offices exist in Germany as part of regional or local government . \\n A work instruction introduced in 1996 requires government staff in the Arbeitsämter – local employment agencies and social security offices operated by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs – to mark companies owned by Scientologists with the letter \" S \" . Where companies are suspected of having Scientologist staff , prospective employees are',\n",
       " 'alerted to this fact by government staff . Government officials have publicised the names of individual Scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses ; some businesspeople have placed advertisements in the press saying they are not Scientologists in order to avoid the associated stigma . \\n Due to concerns about possible government infiltration by Scientologists , applicants for civil service positions in Bavaria are required to declare whether or not they are Scientologists , and a similar policy has been instituted in Hesse . Companies tendering for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not Scientologists ; in 2001 , this requirement was changed , and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that \" the technology of L. Ron Hubbard will not be',\n",
       " 'used in executing the contract \" . When it became known that Microsoft \\'s Windows 2000 operating system included a disk defragmenter developed by Executive Software International ( a company headed by a Scientologist ) , this caused concern among German government officials and clergy over data security and the potential for espionage . To assuage these concerns , Microsoft Germany agreed to provide a means to disable the utility . Following letters of complaint about discrimination from Scientology lawyers , some American companies such as General Electric , IBM and Ford Motor Company instructed their German subsidiaries to cease the use of protective declarations . \\n The city-state of Hamburg set up a full-time office dedicated to opposing Scientology , the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior',\n",
       " 'Authority , under the leadership of Ursula Caberta . In 2005 , in a case brought by a Scientologist , the Federal Administrative Court of Germany ordered the city of Hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community , finding that the practice infringed religious freedom . In June 2008 , the Hamburg Administrative Court fined the city of Hamburg 5,000 Euros ( $ 7,000 ) for not complying with court instructions banning the use of \" sect filters . \" Internet links to sample filters to be used by businesses had continued to remain available . Eileen Barker , a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics , has noted that \" Germany has gone further than any other Western European',\n",
       " 'country in restricting the civil rights of Scientologists . \" The Hamburg task force was closed down in August 2010 as a result of budget cuts ; Caberta moved to a position within the Hamburg interior authority , where she continues her work on Scientology . \\n Scientologists have been banned from joining major political parties in Germany such as the Christian Democratic Union , the Christian Social Union of Bavaria , the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Free Democratic Party . Existing Scientologist members of these parties have been \" purged \" , according to Time Magazine . Scientologists have been prevented from running employment and au pair agencies in Germany ; Scientologists who were running such agencies had their permits revoked . In 1995 ,',\n",
       " \"a sports scientist and former member of the German national fencing team was dismissed from his job at the German Olympic fencing centre after he stated in an interview that he had enjoyed reading books by L.

       " '= = Initiative to ban Scientology = = \\n In March 2007 , it was reported that German authorities were increasing their efforts to monitor Scientology in response to the opening of a new Scientology headquarters in Berlin . On December 7 , 2007 , German federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the Scientology organization was continuing to pursue anti-constitutional goals , restricting \" essential basic and human rights like the dignity of man or the right to equal treatment \" , and asked Germany \\'s domestic intelligence agencies to collect and evaluate the information required for a possible judicial inquiry aimed at banning the organization . \\n The move was criticized by German politicians from all sides of the political spectrum , with legal experts',\n",
       " 'and intelligence agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely fail in the courts . Sabine Weber , president of the Church of Scientology in Berlin , called the accusations \" unrealistic \" and \" absurd \" and said that the German interior ministers \\' evaluation was based on \" a few sentences out of 500,000 pages of Scientological literature \" . She added , \" I can also find hundreds of quotes in the Bible that are totalitarian but that doesn \\'t mean I will demand the ban of Christianity . \" \\n In November 2008 , the government abandoned its attempts to ban Scientology , after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity . The report by the BfV cited knowledge gaps',\n",
       " 'and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful . First , the BfV report stated there was no evidence that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization ; there were German churches and missions , a German board , German bylaws , and no evidence that the organization was \" totally remote-controlled \" from the United States . A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one . The second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was Scientology \\'s aggressive opposition to the constitution . Here , the report found that Scientology \\'s behaviour gave no grounds to assume that Scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow Germany \\'s free and',\n",
       " 'democratic basic order . \" Neither its bylaws nor any other utterances \" supported the \" conclusion that the organization had criminal aims \" . The BfV also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were practising medicine without a licence , but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning . \\n Commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt , Ehrhart Körting , Berlin \\'s interior minister , said , \" This organization pursues goals – through its writings , its concept and its disrespect for minorities – that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution . But they put very little of this into practice . The appraisal of',\n",
       " 'the Government at the moment is that [ Scientology ] is a lousy organization , but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to . \" The Church of Scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision , describing it as the \" only one possible \" . Monitoring of Scientology \\'s activities by the German intelligence services continues . \\n In February 2009 , the Berlin Administrative Court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an advertising column next to a bus stop in front of the Berlin Scientology headquarters , warning passers-by of the potential dangers Scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom , should be removed . The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Upper Administrative Court',\n",

Richard Cohen for example , writing in the Washington Post , said in 1996 : \" Scientology might be one weird religion , but the German reaction to it is weirder still – not to mention disturbing . \" Alan Cowell , writing in the New York Times , wrote in 1997 that the German response to Scientology – motivated by officials \\' fear that Scientology \" was a totalitarian movement growing , like',\n",
       " 'the Nazi party , from inconsequential beginnings \" – was itself redolent of \" the Nazi era \\'s authoritarianism \" . \\n The U.S. Department of State has repeatedly claimed that Germany \\'s actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of Scientologists \\' individual rights posed by sect filters . The U.S. Department of State began to include the issue of Scientology in Germany in its annual human rights reports after the 1993 agreement between the Church of Scientology and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , through which Scientology gained the status of a tax-exempt religion in the United States . That decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts by the Church of Scientology in Washington',\n",
       " ', using paid lobbyists . The State Department \\'s 1996 human rights report on Germany , released in January 1997 , warned that artists and businesses with Scientology connections \" may face boycotts and discrimination , sometimes with government approval . \" Past targets of such actions had included Scientologist actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta , as well as jazz pianist Chick Corea . \\n Also in January 1997 , an open letter to then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared , published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune , drawing parallels between the \" organized oppression \" of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies espoused by Germany in the 1930s . The letter was conceived and paid for by Hollywood lawyer Bertram Fields , whose clients have',\n",
       " 'included Tom Cruise and John Travolta , and was signed by 34 prominent figures in the U.S. entertainment industry , including the top executives of MGM , Warner Bros. , Paramount , Universal and Sony Pictures Entertainment as well as actors Dustin Hoffman and Goldie Hawn , director Oliver Stone , writers Mario Puzo and Gore Vidal and talk-show host Larry King . It echoed similar parallels drawn by the Church of Scientology itself , which until then had received scant notice , and was followed by lobbying efforts of Scientology celebrities in Washington . \\n U.S. Department of State spokesman Nicholas Burns rejected the Nazi comparisons in the open letter as \" outrageous \" and distanced the U.S. government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology',\n",
       " ', saying , \" We have criticized the Germans on this , but we aren \\'t going to support the Scientologists \\' terror tactics against the German government . \" Chancellor Kohl , commenting on the letter , said that those who signed it \" don \\'t know a thing about Germany and don \\'t want to know . \" German officials argued that \" the whole fuss was cranked up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won \\'t give them : tax-exempt status as a religion . This is intimidation , pure and simple . \" Officials explained that precisely because of Germany \\'s Nazi past , Germany took a determined stance against all \" radical cults and sects , including right-wing Nazi groups \" , and',\n",
       " 'not just against Scientology . Kohl \\'s Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as \" absurd \" and cited German court rulings stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a \" contemptuous cartel of oppression \" . \\n In February 1997 , a United States immigration court judge granted asylum to a German Scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland . In April 1997 , John Travolta met personally with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a conference in Philadelphia . Travolta later said Clinton assured him that he would \" really love to help \" with the \" issue over in Germany with Scientology \" . According to Travolta , Clinton recalled',\n",
       " 'that \" he had a roommate years ago who was a Scientologist and had really liked him , and respected his views on it \" , stating that Scientologists \" were given an unfair hand in [ Germany ] and that he wanted to fix it \" . In September 1997 , John Travolta , Chick Corea and fellow Scientologist Isaac Hayes were heard by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe ( CSCE , also known as the Helsinki Commission ) , voicing their complaints about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany , and had a briefing with United States National Security Advisor Sandy Berger , whom Clinton had assigned to be \" the administration \\'s Scientology point person \" . The German ambassador responded with a',\n",
       " 'letter to the CSCE stating that the German government had come to the conclusion that Scientology \\'s \" pseudo-scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals \\' mental and physical health and that it exploits its members \" , adding that \" membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency , to financial ruin , and even to suicide . In addition , there are indications that Scientology poses a threat to Germany \\'s basic political principles . \" \\n A United Nations report in April 1998 raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect filters . However , it rejected the comparison of the treatment of Scientologists with that of Jews during the Nazi era . \\n In 2000 , the German Stern magazine published the results',\n",
       " 'of its investigation of the asylum case . It asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her asylum application – ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a Scientologist – had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of Scientology \\'s Office of Special Affairs , and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax evasion at the time she applied for asylum . On a 2000 visit to Clearwater , Florida , Ursula Caberta of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority likewise alleged that the asylum case had been part of an \" orchestrated effort \" by Scientology undertaken \" for political gain',\n",
       " '\" , and \" a spectacular abuse of the U.S. system \" . German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater , in turn , accused Caberta of stoking a \" hate campaign \" in Germany that had \" ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists \" and maintained that Scientologists had not \" exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States . \" Mark Rathbun , a ( former ) top Church of Scientology official , said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case , \" there would have been nothing improper if it had . \" \\n In 2003 , Joachim Güntner , writing in the Swiss Neue Zürcher Zeitung , noted that Gerhard Besier , a German Christian theologian , director of the',\n",
       " 'Hannah Arendt Institute for Research into Totalitarianism in Dresden and recipient of an honorary doctorate from Lund University , Sweden , for his championing of religious freedom , had been pressured to forego publication of his scientific study of Scientology after having found himself the subject of widespread criticism in the German media for advocating a more tolerant attitude towards Scientology . Güntner concluded that \" alarmism \" had \" triumphed \" over science and noted an apparent lack of confidence in Germany \\'s ability to engage in open public discourse on the matter . \\n The U.S. Department of State \\'s 2012 report on religious freedom in Germany , published in 2013 , stated that \" The status of the Church of Scientology remains in limbo .

A wholly private endeavour , the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority ; it was organised by New Zealand international player Joseph Warbrick , promoted by civil servant Thomas Eyton , and managed by James Scott , a publican .

      "/tmp/ipykernel_161668/2064750381.py:4: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
